; font-size: 20px;"> Minerva's List is a scholarship aggregator that matches students with scholarships that are relevant and reliable. Unlike other scholarship websitess, the unique thing about minerva's list is that authorative figures, such as guidance counselors, have full control over the scholarship databases and can input and delete scholarships they deem fit for their students (such as scholarships for their specific city, scholarship alumni from that school has receieved etc). In addition, students have the option to select how many scholarships they want to see and how much time they have to filter out scholarships by deadline. </p>
