; font-size: 20px;"> Hi! My name is Nujha Bhuiyan and I am a sophomore at UVA majoring in Computer Science. I am an enthusiastic learner and am always eager to learn about all things tech and gain knowledge and expertise from hands on experience. Growing up in a place where I had no female role model in tech, I am very passioante about empowering and supporting women in tech and have worked with organizations like Girls Who Code and Girl Develop It, besides being an active member of my college's chapter of GWC and WiCS. During my free time, if I'm not binging my favorite shows or going out, I sometimes write and try my hand at digital art</p>
